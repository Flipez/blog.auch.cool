I recently stumbled over the [Catan style boardgame 2.0](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2525047) from Dakanzla and thought it would be nice to print my own version of it.

Doing this I noticed how hard it was do collect all information, find the right models for the version of wanted and finally printing it. Therefore I am writing this post helping others to create their version of Catan.

## Basics

Catan consists of a base game which is extendable from four up to six players. In addition there are several extentions which are made for four players and also have six player extensions.



| Type   | Base Game | 6 Player Extension |
|--------|:---------:|:------------------:|
| Brick  | 3 | 2 |
| Desert | 1 | 1 |
| Ore    | 3 | 2 |
| Wheat  | 4 | 2 |
| Wood   | 4 | 2 |
| Wool   | 4 | 2 |
