First day was fairly simple. You need to find the two-pair combination (part 1) that sums up to 2020 and the three-pair combination (part 2).

Then simply multiply each of the numbers within the combination. The result is the solution for the puzzle.

Unfortunately due to an [outage](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4ejjz/2020_day_1_unlock_crash_postmortem/) day 1 will not result in any points on the leaderboards.
