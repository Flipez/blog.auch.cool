I am tinkering on stuff that runs the internet at [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org).

Previously I broke things in parallel on a lot of servers in a
[hosting company](https://hetzner.com). I have both unconventional and practical
solutions for every challenge, with a preference for scalability and general applicability.
I do temporary things that live forever occasionally too.

Lost my heart to Ruby, love photography, mountain biking and ‚Äúcatching the latest flicks‚Äù - as the cool kids say across the pond.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/flipez),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mueller-r/),
[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/Flipez/) and my photos [self-hosted](https://photos.auch.cool) and
