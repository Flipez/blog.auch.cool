# ðŸ¥¤ spezi & cola

A completely subjective test of different Spezi and Cola brands that I got my hands on. Let me now if one is missing!

#### Ratings

*Sweetness* describes the taste and how sweet it tastes without directly refering the amount of sugar in the drink - **2.5 out of 5** is my personal fav here.

*Fruityness* describes how much fruit you can tast. **3 to 4 out of 5** would be perfect for me in a Spezi.

A *Syntetic* taste sometimes accours in different types and oftes is a bit bitter. **Less is better.**

Depending on the type and also how it's delivered, *Fizz* does vary a lot. For me **about 3 to 4** would be best.

Last but not least, *Sugar* is refering directly to the amount of sugar per 100ml and is recalculated to a scale of 1 to 5 while 1 being the drink with least sugar and 5 being the drink with most sugar in it.
