I am tinkering on stuff that runs the internet over at [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org).

Previously I broke things in parallel on a lot of servers in a
[hosting company](https://hetzner.com). I have both unconventional and practical
solutions for every challenge, with a preference for scalability and general applicability.
I do temporary things that live forever occasionally too.

Lost my heart to Ruby, love photography, mountain biking and “catching the latest flicks” - as the cool kids say across the pond.
